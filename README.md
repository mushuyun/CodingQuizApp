# CodingQuizApp
**This is a multiple choice quiz app.** It starts with a start quiz button, and the quiz stars after the button is clicked. The quiz is timed. If the timer reaches zero, quiz stops and shows the score page. It will also tell you if the answer you pick is correct or wrong. 
This app is equipped with a clear score button to clear the record as well as a go back button for you to restart the quiz.
